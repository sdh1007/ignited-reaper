## 🎓 Key Concepts

### Gothic Aesthetic Philosophy

**"Digital Necromancy"** - A cyber-gothic fusion that combines:

- 🌙 **3 AM graveyard feeling** - Intimate, immersive, slightly unnerving yet inviting
- 🔥 **Ember warmth** - Life within death, glowing lanterns in darkness
- 💎 **Spectral clarity** - Clean typography, high contrast, readable
- 🌫️ **Atmospheric depth** - Fog, vignettes, layered backgrounds

### Color Strategy

- **Primary**: Deep blues/purples (mystery, depth)
- **Accent**: Ember red (#ee5a6f) - warmth, life, brand
- **Interactive**: Cyan (#4A90A4) - clarity, technology, focus
- **Text**: Silver tones (high contrast, readability)

### Animation Philosophy

- **Micro**: 150ms (instant feedback)
- **Small**: 300ms (comfortable)
- **Medium**: 400ms (deliberate)
- **Cinematic**: 4000ms (memorable)
- **Respect**: Always honor `prefers-reduced-motion`

### Performance Philosophy

- **Target**: 60 FPS desktop, 30+ FPS mobile
- **Strategy**: Adaptive rendering based on real-time FPS
- **Priority**: User experience > visual fidelity
- **Graceful**: Degrade quality, not functionality

### Accessibility Philosophy

- **Inclusive**: Everyone can access all features
- **Proactive**: Announce actions, don't just label
- **Flexible**: Multiple input methods (mouse, keyboard, touch, voice)
- **Standards**: WCAG AAA compliance (7:1 contrast)
